Are you quiet and observant? Hot and clueless? Over a dozen different character builds change how you interact with the world and how your story unfolds.\r\n[*] [b]Original monster designs.[/b] Every monster and supernatural being in the game is an original Abby Howard design-- you won't find any predictable vampires or zombies here.\r\n[*] [b]Five romance options.[/b] Whether you're into goths, dads, plant-lovers, Youtubers, or skeletal boys, we've got all your bases covered.\r\n[*] [b]Dozens of meticulously hand-drawn and traditionally inked backgrounds.[/b] Every background in the game is meticulously drawn by hand and inked on massive 19x24 inch paper.\r\n[*] [b]Hundreds of hand-drawn, immersive sprites.[/b] Each major character has dozens of hand-drawn sprites that interact with backgrounds and capture a full range of lighting and emotion.\r\n[/list]","strSnippet":"The free-to-play first episode of a horror-mystery game with dark humor and hand-drawn art from award-winning graphic novelist Abby Howard."}}],["friends",{"version":1,"data":{"your_info":{"owned":true},"in_game":[],"played_recently":[],"played_ever":[],"owns":[],"in_wishlist":[]}}]]
