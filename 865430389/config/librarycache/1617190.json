You assume the role of [b]Alexander Volkov[/b], the calculating son of a former Lieutenant who is determined to survive in any way he can. The republic's three-year war against the neighboring [b]Kingdom Of Leiden[/b] has pushed the country to its absolute breaking point- and in its final months, Alexander grapples not only with his harsh work but also his decaying mental state.\r\n\r\nUse diplomacy and economics to build a profitable farm, maintain your relationship with enemies and allies alike- and above all else [b]come out on top.[/b]\r\n\r\n[img]https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1617190/extras/headerartnew2.png?t=1643756405[/img]\r\nThe game is divided into three phases:\r\n\r\n[b]DAY[/b]:\r\n\r\nBuild an automated farm in order to sell crops and make as much profit as possible before sunset. Here you can build machines, complete trades, and research new technologies.\r\n\r\n[b]NIGHT[/b]:\r\n\r\nNavigate through a visual novel style interaction with a random character. The game currently features many different interactions with multiple routes and ways to complete them.\r\n\r\n[b]MORNING[/b]:\r\n\r\nGather intel to use in the coming day and night. Read the news about the state of the war, look at stock prices, and read the mail.\r\n\r\n[img]https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1617190/extras/headerartnew3.png?t=1643756405[/img]\r\nArmaCulture is now fully complete. It was made with the Unity 2D engine, Aseprite, Adobe Photoshop, and FL studio entirely by me.\r\n\r\nThank you to all my friends and family members who supported the development of this game!","strSnippet":"ArmaCulture is an indie factory-builder RPG set in the midst of a bitter, industrialized war between two nations in a fictional world similar to our own. The game combines illustrated character art with stylized pixel art to create a unique and dark historic atmosphere."}}]]
