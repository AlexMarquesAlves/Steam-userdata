Oh, and don't forget to kill Hellga!\r\n\r\n[h2]Storytime[/h2]\r\nOrc king Littlehead had a beautiful (by Orc's standards at least) daughter called Hellga. She wanted to marry a prince, but because she was heavily influenced by misunderstood multiculturalism she decided to turn down all proposals from orc princes. She asked her father to send messengers to neighboring lands instead, but no human, dwarf or undead prince was interested to marry her (not because she was an orc, but because of her personality of course). The rejections were quite polite but princess Hellga got upset anyway. She cursed all the princes and turned them into small warriors, who now have to fight for her pleasure in arenas placed in her room.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/759850/extras/steam_gr_transparent.png?t=1518775131[/img]\r\n\r\n[h2]Features[/h2]\r\n[list][*]9 fantasy heroes with unique stats and skills\r\n[*]4 game modes\r\n[*]14 different maps\r\n[*]31 Steam Achievements\r\n[*]6 Steam Trading Cards (coming soon)\r\n[*]3 Leaderboards\r\n[*]DEBUFF – To motivate the warriors to fight, Hellga periodically stomps her feet which causes -10 hp loss to all \r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]Game modes[/h2]\r\n[list][*]Campaign – finish all 9 levels to enter additional stages with increasing difficulty.\r\n[*]Multiplayer – with human players or bots:\r\n[list][*]Battle – free for all, gain experience, rating and gold for killing opponents and/or staying alive last.\r\n[*]Boss (raid) – cooperate with others to take down Hellga, the boss.\r\n[*]KillBall – help your team (blue/red) to win a football match, don't die in the process. \r\n[/list]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]Heroes[/h2]\r\n[list][*][b]Knight[/b] (melee attack) – Grumpy old chap, gets things done the old way, the sword way.\r\n[i](Special: kickback and critical damage)[/i]\r\n[*][b]Marksman[/b] (range attack) – Not saying he's a coward or anything, but he likes to attack from safe distance with his trustworthy bow.\r\n[i](Special: frost spell (slowing target))[/i]\r\n[*][b]Mage[/b] (area effect attack) – He might look at us in a haughty manner with his fancy glowing stick and what not, but in reality he doesn't discriminate.
