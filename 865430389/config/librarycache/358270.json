Race for the finish line, leaving a trail of burnt rubber and spent brass behind youâ€¦ along with the flaming wreckage of anyone reckless enough to get in your way.\r\nPick up more ammo and turbo from the side of the track, and floor the pedal while performing some shady deals for The Dealer. No trick is too dirty when you're preparing for The Final Confrontation. Only the hardest armor, the most powerful engine and the biggest guns will see you through the ultimate battle against The Adversary.\r\n\r\nAnd when you feel you can't take it anymore, you can check out the underground market. Spiked bumpers, landmines, rocket fuel or sabotage can provide a way to create some nasty accidents for the competition.\r\n\r\nPlay alone or with friends!
